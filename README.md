Learn NLTK Basics

# NLTK Example Project

This program is a simple demonstration of using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python for text processing and analysis.

## Getting Started
NLTK is a powerful library in Python that provides easy-to-use interfaces for working with human language data. It's particularly useful for beginners in NLP for the following reasons:

1. **User-Friendly:** NLTK is designed to be beginner-friendly, with simple interfaces for common NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.

2. **Educational Resources:** NLTK comes with extensive documentation and educational resources. It's a great tool for learning about the fundamentals of NLP algorithms and techniques.

3. **Community Support:** NLTK has a vibrant community, making it easy to find help and resources online. You can connect with other learners, ask questions, and share your experiences.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and NLTK installed on your system. You can install NLTK using the following:

```bash
pip install nltk

Installation of nltk.package

Open python via 

	  import nltk
	  nltk.download()
 run the code to download all packaage
